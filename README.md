# Data Analysis of COVID-19 in Mexico

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico, identifying particularly vulnerable demographics during four distinct waves from March 2020 to March 2022. The goal is to understand which demographic segments were most affected by the pandemic in 2020 and to help devise targeted interventions for future health crises.

## Key Objectives
Examine the impact of age, gender, pre-existing health conditions, and lifestyle habits on COVID-19 mortality and severity.
Identify high-risk populations to better prioritize governmental resources and aid during future pandemics.

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes a dataset made available by the Mexican government on Kaggle under the CC0 Public Domain License. It includes anonymized data of over a million patients, with details on pre-existing conditions, demographic information, and COVID-19 severity levels.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Initial data cleaning and preparation using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Statistical summaries and visualizations to understand distributions and relationships within the data.
- In-depth Analysis: Focused studies on the influence of various factors like age, gender, and lifestyle on patient outcomes.

## Key Findings
The severity of COVID-19 outcomes varies significantly with factors like age, gender, and existing health conditions.
Certain unhealthy lifestyle habits (tobacco use, obesity, diabetes) are linked to increased severity of the disease, particularly in demographic subsets such as pregnant women.

## Tools Used
- Python for data analysis, including libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Plotly for visualization.
- Jupyter Notebooks for organizing and sharing the analytical workflow.

## References
Relevant studies and resources are cited in the Jupyter notebook report, including articles from peer-reviewed journals and data sources from government databases.
